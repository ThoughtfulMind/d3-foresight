- for each model
  - id: unique identifier
  - stats: TODO
  - meta: TODO
  - predictions: A list like
    - [null,
       null,
       {
         seriesValues: [{point: 3.4, low: [2.1, 4.5], high: [2.1, 4.5]}, ...],
         pointValues: {
           x: {onset: {point: 3.4, low: [2.1, 4.5], high: [2.1, 4.5]}}
           xy: {peak: {x: {point: 3.4, low: [2.1, 4.5], high: [2.1, 4.5]}, y: {point: 3.4, low: [2.1, 4.5], high: [2.1, 4.5]}}}

       },
       null]

* Other tasks
** DONE Plot for showing probability distribution
CLOSED: [2017-03-31 Fri 00:52]
- Might have to make the control-panel survive outside the timeChart
- Needs
  - list of models with
    - id
    - meta
    - stats
    - x values (131 or 33 numbers)
    - y values (probabilities for each x)
  - actual value, if present
** DONE Take arguments in control-panel
CLOSED: [2017-03-31 Fri 03:58]
** DONE Fix mutation of model getter
CLOSED: [2017-04-11 Tue 03:09]
** TODO Handle stats cases with no predictions
** Distributions chart
- Take complete data for each week and pass to each panel
- Panel generates a dropdown and uses ~Prediction~ and ~Actual~ to plot the curves
- Main class probably maintains week pointer and updates across the major axis
  (time axis)
- Pointer gets updated on each forward/backward event from control-panel and
  also triggers a hook (check how this works in time-chart)
** Optimize bundle

** TODO Document usage
** TODO Move starting week thing in flusight
** TODO Add text specifying the target for panels
** TODO Convert that text to dropdown menu
** TODO Clear and redraw plots on tab change but with same season / region /  week
